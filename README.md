# Pitch & Description
Monday Morning is a platforming game where you manipulate a living bed and the environment to keep a character from dying. Monday Morning is a form of entertainment unlike any other in the industry. Monday Morning will help our consumers avoid the toils of boredom through humor and comedy.

Our application will put the player in control of a living bed. This odd player character will create a fun new way of playing. The objective is to keep another character alive while he/she sleeps.
